    "This code block executes the bidirectional RRT algorithm to find an optimal path between a starting point and an ending point, taking into account obstacles in the environment. The algorithm generates a series of frames showing the evolution of the RRT trees created during execution, along with the final path found. Initially, the algorithm performs *num_iterations* iterations of the bidirectional RRT, adding nodes to the RRT trees starting from the starting point and ending point. At each iteration, it checks whether the last nodes added to the trees are sufficiently close to each other. If yes, a final path is constructed by combining the paths from the root trees to the neighboring nodes.\n",

Each frame shows the current state of the RRT trees, with the nodes represented as points in the graph and the paths between nodes represented by lines."
